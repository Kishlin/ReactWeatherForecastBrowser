# ReduxWeatherForecastBrowser

Look up weather forecasts for the 7 coming days with this app using React and Redux. Charts are built with [React-Sparklines](https://github.com/borisyankov/react-sparklines).

The app also uses [the apixu api](https://www.apixu.com/) which requires an API key, if you want to make the project run locally, rename `./src/constants/.constants.js` to `./src/constants/constants.js` and fill in your Firebase credentials.


You can [try the app live here](https://kishlin.github.io/ReactWeatherForecastBrowser/).
